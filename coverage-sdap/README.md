# coverage-sdap
A Jupyter notebook to illustrate how to make calls to SDAP for
COVERAGE-related analytics.  You can click on the notebook file above and
Github should render it for you to view.

If you would like to run the notebook you may download it and install it in
any Jupyter server that you have access to.  If you don't have access to a
Jupyter server, you can easily run your own on your laptop by following
these steps.

1. Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file in your
Python distribution.
2. Run `jupyter notebook` in the directory containing the notebook file.
That should automatically open a web page in Jupyter.
3. Just click on the notebook you would like to run.
